Fibonacci Numbers using Dynamic Programming and Recursion in Python
=====================================================================

Why
----
I was bored this afternoon so I decided to create a quick program that
generates Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming with the purpose 
of timing the two both to compare the results and to learn about
Python's `timeit` module.

What's Here?
-------------
There are two classes, `Fib` and `dpFib`. These are the implementation
files. Inside of `main.py` I use these implementations and `timeit` to 
measure the performance of both implementations. A sample set of results
gotten from my Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro can be found in `results.txt`
